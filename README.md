## Currently
I'm currently in my final semester at Northwest Missouri state university in the applied computer science program. 
## Background
I belong to the southern part of India. I have completed my undergraduate studies from JB Institute Of Engineering and Technology in Information Technology. This is the place where I have been exposed to coding. and I have no prior experience. Apart from studies I love playing cricket and watch web series and sometimes I also read novels.
## Plans
 My ultimate goal is to get into the IT industry as a Full-Stack developer.
